# Strict Processing

Strict Processing only applies to Division 1 cards.  When filling out a card
with Strict Processing the following restrictions apply:

* All players must be added to the card before the match starts
* Every player must be assigned a shirt number
* Only umpires can assign Red/Yellow cards
* Cards must be closed within 3 hours of the match start time

The purpose of strict processing is to ensure that teams maintain a high
standard of matchcard reporting.  This is necessary for national
competitions.

Players without numbers are highlighted with a Red border.
