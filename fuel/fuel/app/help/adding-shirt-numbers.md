# Shirt Numbers

For strict matchcards, all players must have a shirt number assigned.

To assign a shirt number:

1. Click on the player below
2. Select 'Profile' from the menu
3. Put the correct shirt number in the 'Number' field.
4. Save you changes by clicking the 'Save' button.

Repeat for all players who do not have a number assigned.

The shirt number is remembered, so this only needs to be done once for each
player - unless their number changes.
